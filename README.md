## Installation
The **installation** is super simple and shouldn't take more than a minute:
1. Open the CC:Tweaked computer (advanced computer works too).
2. Type `pastebin get kzNsFCkD write`.
3. Once the download is over, type `write` to run the program.
4. The program is up and running!

To **uninstall the program**, type `delete write` in the directory where you installed it.

## Host the script on your own
If the pastebin link gets removed/doesn't work, you can **host the script on your own**:
1. Copy the content of the `app.lua` file.
2. Go to [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and paste everything you copied under "New paste".
3. Scroll down and press "Create new paste".
4. Go to the URL bar and copy the alphanumerical code after "https://pastebin.com/".

 5. In minecraft, open a CC:Tweaked computer and type 
 `pastebin get < yourCode > write`
 replacing "< yourCode >" with the alphanumerical code you copied (e.g `pastebin get y2YnTLMf write`)
 6. Once the download is over, type `write` to run the program.
 7. The program is up and running!
